                    Helping Hands started in 2022 as a result of the need to give hope to a better
                     future and a means of finding a solution to Sustainable Development Goal 1 whose 
                     agenda is to end poverty i.e No Poverty. This initiative was founded by a group of tech 
                     women from Africa to find a solution and a means to eradicate and help shape the world
                      to a better and beautiful place where children live happily, graduates secure better
                       opportunities,  great employable skills are learnt, connections made, education is
                        valued and in all poverty is eradicated. According to a research, poverty can be said 
                        to be a state or condition in which a person or community lacks financial resources and 
                        essentials to enjoy a minimum standard of life and well-being that's considered acceptable 
                        in the society.Some of these causes may include lack of education, lack of relevant skills, 
                        lack of food and  social injustice just to mention a few which are a stepping stone to poverty.  
                        This was considered and hence this site was developed to help address the Sustainable 
                    Development Goal 1 of the UnitedNations that has overwhelmed Africa and the rest of the world.

                 <p class="blogcont">Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains<br> one of
                      the greatest challenges facing humanity. <br>While the number of people
                       living in<br> extreme poverty
                       dropped by more<br>
                      than half between 1990 and 2015,<br> too many are still struggling
                       for the<br> most basic human needs.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
                    As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 
                    a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth
                     in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty,
                      but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men 
                      because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.  
                    Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and 
                    sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. 
                    New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work 
                    is needed to bring people out of poverty.          
                    The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end po
                    verty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting 
                    the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting 
                    communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.</span></p>

                     as hunger<br> and poverty are connected.

                 SDG 1 is linked<br> to reduced inequalities (SDG 10) <br>as inequality

                 gendered effects under gender equality
                 (SDG 5) also affects the outcomes of decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

                SDG 1 particularly links to good health and well-being 
                (SDG 3) as eradication of poverty will necessarily increase the standard of living.

                Furthermore, it affects the availability of quality education 
                for all (SDG 4) as academic costs become unaffordable, and drinking 
                water (SDG 6) inaccessible and many others.[22]

                     or 8% of the total human population. This would be the first time that poverty has
                      increased globally in thirty years, since 1990. More than 700 
                    million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, 
                    still live in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic 
                    needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few.
                    The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa. 
                      Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per cent—more than three 
                    times higher than in urban areas.
                    
                    For those who work, having a job does not 
                   guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers
                   and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. One out
                   of five children live in extreme poverty. Ensuring social protection for 
                   all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty.
