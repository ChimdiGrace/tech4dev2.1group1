                <p class="blongconth">Goal-No Poverty</p>
             <p class="blogcont">Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains<br> one of
                  the greatest challenges facing humanity. <br>While the number of people
                   living in<br> extreme poverty
                   dropped by more<br>
                  than half between 1990 and 2015,<br> too many are still struggling
                   for the<br> most basic human needs.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> 
                As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 
                a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid growth
                 in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty,
                  but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to be poor than men 
                  because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.  
                Progress has also been limited in other regions, such as South Asia and 
                sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. 
                New threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work 
                is needed to bring people out of poverty.          
                The SDGs are a bold commitment to finish what we started, and end po
                verty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting 
                the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and services, and supporting 
                communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.</span></p>

                <p class="blongconth">Links with other SDGs!</p>
                <p class="blogcont"> The SDGs are interlinked as one growth<br> can positively affect 
                another and<br> vice versa. Eradicating poverty can<br> lead to zero hunger (SDG 2)
                 as hunger<br> and poverty are connected.

             SDG 1 is linked<br> to reduced inequalities (SDG 10) <br>as inequality 
             around<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">the world remains high, and poverty has
             significant impacts on measures of inequality.
             At the same time, access to decent work which has both
             gendered effects under gender equality
             (SDG 5) also affects the outcomes of decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

            SDG 1 particularly links to good health and well-being 
            (SDG 3) as eradication of poverty will necessarily increase the standard of living.

            Furthermore, it affects the availability of quality education 
            for all (SDG 4) as academic costs become unaffordable, and drinking 
            water (SDG 6) inaccessible and many others.[22]

                <p class="blogcont">   Globally, the number of people living<br> in extreme poverty 
                    declined from<br> 36 per
                 cent in 1990 to 10 per cent<br> in 2015. But the pace of change is <br>decelerating and 
                 the COVID-19<br> crisis risks reversing decades of progress <br>
                in the fight against poverty.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">  New research published by the UNU World Institute 
                for Development Economics Research warns that the economic fallout from 
                the global pandemic could increase global poverty by as much as half a billion people,
                 or 8% of the total human population. This would be the first time that poverty has
                  increased globally in thirty years, since 1990. More than 700 
                million people, or 10 per cent of the world population, 
                still live in extreme poverty today, struggling to fulfil the most basic 
                needs like health, education, and access to water and sanitation, to name a few.
                The majority of people living on less than $1.90 a day live in sub-Saharan Africa. 
                  Worldwide, the poverty rate in rural areas is 17.2 per centâ€”more than three 
                times higher than in urban areas.
                
                For those who work, having a job does not 
               guarantee a decent living. In fact, 8 per cent of employed workers
               and their families worldwide lived in extreme poverty in 2018. One out
               of five children live in extreme poverty. Ensuring social protection for 
               all children and other vulnerable groups is critical to reduce poverty.
